Famous faces are amongst the most recognizable subjects to human eyes, but what happens when photos of famous faces are mangled using algorithms that re-imagine their composition?

Image processing is done using my custom-made [ImageMirage](https://github.com/j-v/ImageMirage) Python scripts. The ImageMirage algorithms break up images into rectangular regions based on color, then replace the regions with snipped images of roughly similar colors. The effect is a dazzling mosaic of disparate subjects, but the original famous face is still quite recognizable.
