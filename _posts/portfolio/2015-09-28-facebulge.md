[FaceBulge](http://facebulge.jonvolkmar.com) is a hack created by Jon Volkmar, José Tomás Albornoz, Daniel Snider, and Tina Yang. Submit an image containing one or more faces, and FaceBulge will use our special algorithm make them bulge! It may not work as expected on mobile platforms.

We used face detection algorithms from OpenCV on the backend, WebGL for 3d graphics on the frontend, and Node.js as our web framework.

Our code is on GitHub: [https://github.com/j-v/FaceBulge](https://github.com/j-v/FaceBulge)
